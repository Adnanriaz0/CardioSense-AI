# ❤️ CardioSense AI

**CardioSense AI** is an IoT-based Phonocardiogram (PCG) monitoring and AI-powered analysis system. It captures real-time heart sound signals using embedded hardware and analyzes them using deep learning models (CNN, LSTM) to detect cardiac abnormalities. Results are displayed on a responsive doctor dashboard for accurate diagnosis and alerts.
